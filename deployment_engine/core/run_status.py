"""Per-run deploy outcome stamp.

Written by spinup on its exit paths so `./teardown --failed` can target
broken runs deterministically, instead of guessing from which artifact
files happen to exist in the run dir. The guess-from-artifacts approach
misreads a run that provisioned all its VMs but died at a later step
(e.g. a RAMPART deploy that failed AD DC promotion) as "healthy" — it
has deploy-output.json but no post-deploy-output.json — which is exactly
the kind of silent misclassification the fail-loud contract forbids for
a destructive operation.

Contract: spinup stamps FAILED the moment the run dir is created, then
flips it to OK only if it reaches its final return. Any early return,
exception, or hard kill therefore leaves the run stamped FAILED — the
safe default for a teardown filter. A run with no stamp at all (deploys
predating this instrumentation, or a type whose spinup isn't yet wired)
reads as UNKNOWN and is NOT matched by --failed.
