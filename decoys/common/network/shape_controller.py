"""Closed-loop connection-shape controller (Phase 1, 2026-06-16).

PHASE's exp model scores a SUP-day near-binary (pass ~0.999 / dead ~0.00). The
deciding factor is per-connection BYTE/PACKET/DURATION shape + the conn_state
mix — NOT activity volume (a confirmed-dead lever). The runtime already emits a
passing shape on some days and a dead one on others; the failure mode is
day-to-day VARIANCE. This controller specifies the target distribution and
drives the runtime to hit it CONSISTENTLY.

It is the actuator + feedback loop for two PHASE-emitted behavior.json blocks:

  diversity.connection_shape   per-connection target percentile distributions
                               {enabled, orig_bytes/{p25,p50,p75,p90,max},
                                resp_bytes, orig_pkts, resp_pkts, duration}
  diversity.conn_state_mix     {SF, failed_conn, OTH, RSTR} target fractions
                               (FOLD 2026-06-16: REJ+S0 collapsed into
                                failed_conn; SF is the uncontrolled baseline,
                                emitted for reference only)

Phase 1 scope — what this controller actuates TODAY:
  • orig_bytes / duration  → per-connection sampling from the distribution
    (not the p50 scalar) on the persistent-session channel, with a bounded
    multiplicative bias closed-loop-corrected from the EMIT-SIDE ledger.
  • failed_conn fraction   → a per-minute failed-conn probe rate handed to
    scripted_services, computed as failed_conn_frac × the per-minute aggregate
    outbound conn count (OutboundConnSampler — a valid use of /proc: a COUNT,
    not a per-connection distribution).

Deliberately NOT actuated yet (await later backlog builds, see RUSE spec):
  • orig_pkts            → packetization build (#3)
  • resp_bytes/resp_pkts → RUSE-controlled response endpoints (#2)
  • the shape-floor channel (#5) will register as a second emit-side reporter.

Measurement source (RUSE spec §B.1 correction): conn_sampler CANNOT read a
per-connection byte/pkt/duration distribution or conn_state from /proc — those
come from this controller's EMIT-SIDE ledger (channels report each connection
they close). conn_sampler is used only for the aggregate conn COUNT that scales
the failed_conn rate.

Correctness:
  • `max` is a HARD per-connection ceiling — every sample (post-bias) is clamped
    to it (RUSE spec invariant; the dataset MAX is unphysical as a target).
  • Private RNG — sample_*() is called from the persistent-session daemon's OWN
    thread; drawing from global random.* there would corrupt the seed-derived
    AgentLogger.session_id (same rule as persistent_session.py).
  • Additive / absent-safe — a missing block leaves the feature OFF; an
    `enabled:true` block with a malformed distribution WARNS loud (audit-caught)
    and falls back to the daemon's scalar, never crashing the fleet (fail-loud is
    reserved for the load-time mode/missing-file contract, not producer typos).
